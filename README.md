# Appliance-Energy-Prediction---Time-series-Project

The project work focuses on performing time series analysis and modeling on a time series data.  
The data used in the project is recorded based on the amount of energy consumed by appliances in  a household for 4.5 months. 
The project applies all the analysis and preprocessing techniques for  a time series data to make it prepared for the modelling phase. 
Different time series linear models  are used to find the best suitable model to predict the appliance energy consumed in a household.  
The project implementation completely relies on python and the best model for the forecast is  selected using different performance measures.
